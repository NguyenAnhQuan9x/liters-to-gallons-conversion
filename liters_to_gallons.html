            Liters to Gallons Conversion
        </h1>

        <p>
            There are two popular volume units: gallons and liters. The gallon is the English measure of volume, 
            while the liter is the metric unit. The gallon in America and the gallon in Britain, however, are not the same! 
            The actual measurement of a gallon in the US is 231 cubic inches, or 3.785411784 liters. The UK gallon or Imperial 
            gallon is equivalent to about 277.42 cubic inches. Make sure you understand which country is being asked for if you're 
            requested to perform the conversion; otherwise, you won't get the right response. Although the American gallon is used in this example, 
            the setup for the issue is the same for the Imperial gallon (just using 277.42 instead of 3.785).

        <h2>Liters to Gallons Formula</h2>
        <p>
            Although it isn't quite as simple as converting between metric units, which are just multiples of 10, it is
            still not a difficult process.<br>
            The conversion factor is:<br>
            <span id="formula">1 liter = 0.264 US gallons</span><br>
            To find how many gallons are in 4 liters, for example:<br>
            gallons = 4 liters x 0.264 gallons/liter<br>
            The liters cancel out, leaving the gallon unit:<br>
            4 liters = 1.056 gallons<br>
        </p>
        <p>Keep this in mind: there are about 4 liters per US gallon. So, a half gallon is about 2 liters, while 2 gallons is around 8 liters.</p>
        <p>
            In life sometimes we will not have enough time to write the formula then enter the numbers into the calculator 
            and get the result on the screen.
